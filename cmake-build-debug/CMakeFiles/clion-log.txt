CMake Warning at /home/cs/clion-2018.1.3/bin/cmake/share/cmake-3.10/Modules/FindCUDA.cmake:1851 (add_executable):
  Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target sita because files in
  some directories may conflict with libraries in implicit directories:

    runtime library [libglog.so.0] in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu may be hidden by files in:
      /home/cs/caffe_third/for_x86/glog/lib

  Some of these libraries may not be found correctly.
